Abstract
---------

The paper proposes an Euler equation technique for analyzing the stability of
differentiable stochastic programs.  The main innovation is to use marginal
reward directly as a Foster--Lyapunov function.  This allows us to extend
known stability results for stochastic optimal growth models, both weakening
hypotheses and strengthening conclusions.
